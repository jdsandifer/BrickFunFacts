# BrickFunFacts
Simple LEGOÂ® fun facts app.

This was a tutorial project that I took a step further.
Here's a quick summary of my improvements:

- Themed the general fun facts tutorial as a LEGO app.
  (Following LEGO Group guidelines for the use of their
  name - including not putting it in the app title.)

- Researched entirely new facts and increased the amount
  of them in the app.

- Changed colors to match LEGO brick colors as shown on
  the LEGO website.

- Improved the randomization of the facts and colors so
  neither is repeated too often.


And a few additional improvements I have up my sleeve
(for when I have the time...):

- A better randomization system that also keeps facts
  from being repeated until all facts have been shown.

- More colors. Including tweaks to the app styling and 
  icon.

- A way to easily update facts to users of the app.
  And to facilitate storage of really large numbers of
  fun facts without slowing down the UI.
