# BrickFunFacts
A simple LEGOÂ® fun facts app.

This was a tutorial project that I took a step further.
Here's a quick summary of my improvements:

- Themed the general fun facts tutorial as a LEGO app.
  (Followed LEGO Group guidelines for the use of their
  name - including not putting it in the app title.)

- Researched entirely new facts and increased the quantity
  of facts in the app.

- Changed colors to match LEGO brick colors as shown on
  the LEGO website.

- Improved the randomization of the facts and colors so
  neither is repeated too often.

Here's the app on the Google Play store: [Brick Fun Facts](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jdsandifer.brickfunfacts)

When I have time, I'm planning a few additional improvements:

- A better randomization system that keeps facts
  from being repeated until all facts have been shown.

- More colors - including tweaks to the app styling and 
  icons.

- A way to easily update facts to users of the app.
  Should also facilitate storage of lots of
  fun facts without slowing down the UI. (API for facts)
